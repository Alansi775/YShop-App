# Y Shop - An AI-Powered E-commerce Platform with Drone Delivery

Y Shop is a cutting edge e-commerce application built with SwiftUI, designed specifically for store owners and customers.  This platform leverages a robust CNN AI model to ensure compliance with Y Shop's policies, providing a secure and trustworthy shopping experience.
the project still under process now.

## Key Features:

* **Store Management:** Store owners can create and manage their stores within the app.  A comprehensive admin panel allows them to add products, track inventory, and manage orders.  Crucially, the AI model automatically reviews new product listings to ensure they adhere to Y Shop's policies.  Rejected products are flagged and provide clear feedback to the store owner.

* **Customer Experience:**  Customers can easily sign up and log in to browse stores and restaurants, add items to their carts, and complete orders.  A seamless user interface facilitates a smooth shopping experience.

* **AI-Powered Product Verification:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) AI model is integrated to analyze product images and descriptions.  This ensures that all products listed on Y Shop comply with the platform's established policies.  This feature helps maintain a high standard of product quality and prevents the listing of inappropriate or potentially harmful items.

* **Drone Delivery Integration:**  Y Shop utilizes a custom-built drone system, controlled by a Pixhawk, for efficient and timely delivery of orders. The drone system autonomously navigates to the customer's location, collects the order from the store, and delivers it directly to the customer.

* **App Management:**  A dedicated app management panel provides administrators with the ability to:
    * Approve or reject new store applications based on Y Shop's policies.
    * Monitor store performance and product listings.
    * Receive and respond to store requests.
    * Manage and track all aspects of the platform's operations.

## Project Structure:

* **Frontend:** Built using SwiftUI for both store owner and customer interfaces.
* **Backend:**  (Node.js MySQL, AWS, Firebase)
* **AI Model:**  CNN model trained on a dataset of compliant and non-compliant products.
* **Drone System:**  Drone system controlled by a Pixhawk ( Under Process Project ). Drone Viedo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9KZVz2MjMk
